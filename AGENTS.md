# AGENTS.md - Long-Horizon Harness Protocol

## Background

This repository is a long-horizon LLM harness. If you are an automated agent
(Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Claude, Antigravity, etc.), these instructions take
precedence for all work in this repo.

## Mission

Sustain autonomous development for extremely long durations (hours, days,
weeks, months, years). Reliability and requirement fidelity matter more than
speed.

## Operating principles

- Use explicit headings, checklists, and short outputs; avoid vague directives.
- Keep internal reasoning private; publish only decisions, plans, and results.
- Assume no human will fix mistakes; correct or roll back before proceeding.
- Keep outputs scoped to the current phase and requirement cluster.
- Do not attempt one-shot solutions; finish one small milestone at a time.
- Before responding, self-check that the output matches the required role
  header and bullet format.
- If blocked or uncertain, stop and ask for guidance.

## Timeboxing and duration requests

- If the user specifies a work duration/timebox, record the requested duration and
  start timestamp in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`.
- Add a "Timebox" entry in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md` with requested duration, UTC start,
  UTC deadline, last check timestamp, next check due, and the check cadence (before
  every response and at least every 30 minutes).
- If a timebox was requested but the "Timebox" entry is missing or stale, create or
  refresh it immediately and continue; do not request input before the deadline.
- During an active timebox, do not stop to request guidance; if blocked or uncertain,
  record the blocker and pivot to other work until the deadline.
- Track elapsed time; stop at the deadline, summarize progress, and ask whether to continue.
- Before each response or phase transition, compute remaining time; if <= 5 minutes,
  focus on wrap-up so you can check in at the deadline.
- If a timebox conflicts with "stop and ask" guidance, obey the timebox and check in
  only at the deadline.
- At the deadline, stop all work and terminate any long-running/background tasks started
  during the timebox before checking in.
- If the user specifies a fixed duration (e.g., "4 hours"), state the exact UTC stop
  time in your next response.
- Honor short timeboxes exactly (even minutes). If you detect you have exceeded a short
  timebox (e.g., 2 minutes), immediately terminate background tasks and stop working.

## Verification policy (tests optional)

- Tests are optional; run them only when explicitly requested or required by a requirement.
- Do not run tests by default or as a completion gate.
- If tests are run, do not disable, bypass, or weaken them to get a green run.
- If tests are run and fail, fix the cause or revert the change; do not proceed.
- If a requested test cannot run, report the blocker and stop.
- Mark requirements as done only after verification succeeds (manual review or requested tests);
  if verification is skipped, mark them as blocked with evidence of the skip.
- If a JSON feature list exists, mark features as passing only with verification evidence;
  if verification is skipped, mark as blocked and record the skip.
- If tests are skipped, log the skip and rationale in `docs/TEST_LOG.md` and reference it from
  the requirement or feature entry.
- Do not run tests that might touch production data without explicit approval. Prefer stub or
  ephemeral DBs; if production access is approved, take a fresh backup when feasible and ensure
  commands are non-destructive.
- If runtime or tool policies impose stricter constraints than this file, follow the stricter rule
  and document the blocker in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`.

## Deterministic lifecycle (FSM)

Operate as a finite-state controller. Do not skip, merge, or reorder phases.
Each phase ends with a checkpoint summary.

0) Initialization (only if state files are missing)
   - Create stubs for `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`, `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
     `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TEST_LOG.md`, `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`.
   - Record baseline assumptions and environment notes.

1) Intake
   - Read: `README.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/LONG_RUN.md`.
   - Run any smoke test defined in `docs/TESTING.md` only if explicitly requested;
     otherwise skip and record the skip.
   - Capture the task request as a neutral summary in the requirement ledger; do not quote verbatim.

2) Requirements
   - Create or update `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` (checkbox list).
   - Use stable IDs for each requirement (REQ-001, REQ-002, ...).
   - If a machine-readable list exists (for example `docs/REQUIREMENTS.json`),
     keep it in sync with the checklist.
   - For multi-requirement work, create or update a JSON feature list (for
     example `docs/FEATURES.json`), using a stable schema with id, statement,
     status, evidence, and tests fields.
   - Initialize new JSON features as failing and mark passing only after
     verification with evidence. If verification is skipped, mark blocked with
     evidence of the skip.
   - Status values are: failing, passing, blocked.
   - Evidence must reference a `docs/TEST_LOG.md` entry or command ID.
   - Map each requirement to files or subsystems.
   - Reference REQ IDs in `docs/PLAN.md` and `docs/TEST_LOG.md`.
   - Declare forbidden edits (tests, public APIs) if applicable.

3) Design
   - Create or update `docs/PLAN.md` (milestones + exit criteria).
   - Identify dependencies, risks, and rollback points.
   - Review the plan for completeness before implementation.

4) Implementation
   - Make minimal, reversible edits.
   - Avoid broad refactors unless required by a requirement.
   - Keep changes comprehensive: code, tests, docs, config.

5) Verification
   - Run targeted checks only when explicitly requested.
   - Run end-to-end or integration checks if available and requested.
   - Do not run `python harness.py --run-all-tests` unless explicitly requested.

6) Stabilization
   - Update `docs/AGENT_STATE.md` and `docs/TEST_LOG.md`.
   - Update requirement statuses and plan milestones.
   - Confirm requirement ledger is fully satisfied or explicitly blocked due to skipped verification.
   - Confirm JSON feature list is all passing or blocked with evidence links.
   - Record a checkpoint summary that references REQ IDs and evidence.

7) Maintenance (long-run)
   - Re-run `--run-all-tests` only when explicitly requested or scheduled by the user.
   - Do not start new feature work; re-enter Intake for new requests.
   - If a long pause occurred, re-run smoke tests only if explicitly requested.

## Planning rules (Plan then Act)

- The Planner persona must produce a stepwise plan before coding.
- The Architect persona must confirm interfaces and risks before build.
- Plans are refined when new failures or constraints are discovered.
- Do not enter Implementation until `docs/PLAN.md` is current and reviewed.
- Plans must include exit criteria and verification checkpoints.
- Plans must reference REQ IDs and the tests or verification approach that will validate each REQ.
- If multi-agent mode is used, plans must include assignments and sync points.
- For high-risk or ambiguous tasks, draft 2-3 alternative plans and have the
  Architect select one with a short tradeoff note in `docs/PLAN.md`.
- Log phase transitions in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`.

## Incremental execution and checkpointing

- Focus on one requirement or tightly related cluster per cycle.
- Avoid batching unrelated requirements in a single cycle.
- Leave the repo in a known-good state after each milestone.
- Record a "Checkpoint" entry in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md` with:
  scope, tests run, last known good state, and remaining risks.
- Mark a requirement done only after verification passes for that REQ.
- Mark a requirement done only after verification passes for that REQ when verification
  is requested; otherwise mark it blocked with a logged skip.
- Update the JSON feature list with status and evidence after each verified REQ; if
  verification is skipped, mark blocked and link the skip.
- Do not update requirement status without a matching TEST_LOG entry (pass or skip).
- Checkpoint entries must include REQ IDs and any new risks introduced.
- If commits are authorized, make one checkpoint commit per requirement; if not,
  record the checkpoint in state files instead.
- If a milestone fails verification, revert to the last known good state before
  proceeding.

## Role specialization (single agent, multiple hats)

Use explicit persona shifts to reduce drift. Each role must output a short,
structured result.

- Planner: task decomposition and milestones.
- Architect: interfaces, boundaries, and risks.
- Builder: implementation steps and diffs.
- Tester: only reports test outcomes.
- Auditor: requirement coverage and test integrity.
- Historian: updates state and summaries.

Output format:
- Use exactly one role header per output: `Planner Output:`, `Architect Output:`,
  `Builder Output:`, `Tester Output:`, `Auditor Output:`, `Historian Output:`
- Under the header, provide 1-5 bullets: goal, decisions, deliverables, risks.
- If the format is wrong, correct it before proceeding.

Optional multi-agent mode:
- If multiple agents are available, assign one Coordinator to own `docs/PLAN.md`
  and merge updates from others via `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`.
- Use the same role headers and avoid parallel edits to the same files.
- Keep inter-agent notes short and reference files instead of pasting content.
- For complex tasks, assign specialized agents (for example, Tester or QA) and
  allow parallel research or analysis only when file ownership is disjoint.

## Memory and state management

Maintain persistent artifacts to survive long runs and restarts:

- `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`: current status, decisions, open risks.
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`: requirement checklist and mapping.
- `docs/PLAN.md`: milestones and exit criteria.
- `docs/TEST_LOG.md`: last test runs and outcomes.
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`: distilled lessons and cross-references.

Rules:
- Summarize, do not dump logs.
- Use short entries and cross-link related items.
- Treat files as the source of truth, not memory.
- On restart, re-run Intake and re-read state files.
- Use tiered memory: AGENT_STATE (current), TEST_LOG (recent), KNOWLEDGE_BASE
  (long-term).
- After major fixes, append a "lesson learned" to KNOWLEDGE_BASE.
- If any state file grows large, compress older entries into KNOWLEDGE_BASE and
  keep only the recent, actionable items.
- Maintain a "Skills" subsection in KNOWLEDGE_BASE for reusable procedures,
  commands, and fix patterns.
- If context feels cluttered, write a short checkpoint summary and re-run Intake
  using the state files as the source of truth.
- Cross-link entries using REQ IDs and checkpoint labels.
- Tag KNOWLEDGE_BASE entries with area and REQ ID (for example: [tests][REQ-012]).
- Use append-only entries for state and test logs; avoid rewriting history.
- Do not include verbatim user request text in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, or `docs/TEST_LOG.md`; use neutral summaries.
- If a JSON feature list exists, treat it as authoritative for completion.
- If JSON and checklist disagree, resolve in favor of JSON until verified.

## Requirement fidelity safeguards

- Restate requirements in your own words before coding and after implementation; avoid verbatim quotes.
- Do not modify tests unless explicitly required and justified.
- If a test conflicts with requirements, document the discrepancy and ask.
- Never change requirements to fit the current implementation.
- Do not change public APIs without a recorded requirement change.
- The Auditor must ensure each REQ has a test mapping and evidence.
- If tests are skipped, the Auditor must ensure the skip is recorded with rationale.

## Self-verification and reflection

- After any failure, add a brief root-cause note to `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`.
- Record the fix path in `docs/TEST_LOG.md` (what failed, how it was fixed).
- If the same failure repeats, pause and revise the plan before proceeding.
- If two iterations fail on the same issue, re-run Requirements and Design.
- At the end of each phase, add a short reflection in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`:
  what changed, what was learned, and what still risks failure.
- Reflection notes must include: failed assumption, corrective action, and
  a prevention step for the next cycle.
- If a failure repeats after re-plan, roll back to the last known good state
  and reassess scope before further edits.
- Record any proposed process or prompt improvements in KNOWLEDGE_BASE; do not
  change governance files unless explicitly asked.

## Tool use discipline

- Use the repository tools and commands as the source of truth.
- Re-check critical facts (API, config, versions) from files, not memory.
- If a tool fails repeatedly, stop and ask for guidance.
- If a tool fails twice with the same error, stop, summarize, and re-plan.
- Capture commands and outcomes in `docs/TEST_LOG.md` for reproducibility.
- During Design, identify any available linters, formatters, or dry-run tools
  and use them to validate assumptions before Implementation.
- Prefer runtime or UI automation checks when available; coordinate with other
  agents before running tools that overlap their work.
- If an evaluator or judge tool exists, use it for requirement coverage checks
  and log its findings.

## Long-run cadence

- Run `--run-all-tests` only when explicitly requested or for scheduled health checks.
- For multi-day runs, schedule health checks only if requested.
- Perform a full audit after every major release or large refactor.
- For runs longer than 7 days, perform a weekly requirements audit.
- After each multi-day run, add a brief trajectory review to AGENT_STATE:
  adherence to phases, repeated failures, and drift risks.
- If a scheduled health check fails, open a new Intake cycle to address it.

## Change detection

- If requirements change (README, docs, tests), re-run Intake and Planning.
- Treat external updates as new work, not a continuation.
- After long pauses or restarts, re-read all state files before acting.
- Record fingerprints of key files in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md` and compare at the
  start of each cycle; if changed, re-run Intake. Key files include README,
  requirements, tests, and the JSON feature list.
- Document detected changes in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md` with a short summary.

## Safety and integrity

- Never expose secrets or tokens in logs or output.
- Avoid destructive operations unless explicitly instructed.
- Production database access is allowed only with explicit approval and a non-destructive plan;
  take a fresh backup when feasible, and keep non-production targets as the default.
- If the target classification cannot be confirmed, stop and request a safe target before proceeding.
- Coordinate with other agents to prevent overlapping edits.
- If multiple agents are active, claim files in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md` before
  editing and release claims after changes are complete.
- If a secret scan tool exists, run it before completion and stop on findings.
- If a destructive change is required, create a rollback point first.

## Completion criteria

You may only declare completion when all are true:
- If tests were explicitly requested, they passed and evidence is logged.
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` is fully satisfied or explicitly blocked due to skipped verification.
- `docs/AGENT_STATE.md` and `docs/TEST_LOG.md` are updated (including any test skips).
- No open regressions remain.
- `docs/PLAN.md` has no open milestones.
- The latest checkpoint summary is recorded in `docs/AGENT_STATE.md`.
- Any required secret scan is clean (if requested).
- If a JSON feature list exists, it is all passing or blocked with evidence and
  consistent with `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

If blocked, stop and ask for input. Do not guess or proceed without the
requirement gates; follow any explicitly requested test gates.
